# Tests

Native RAM-KV checks: `ninfer_ram_kv_test` covers exact packed page eviction/reload and sparse
GQA against the independent FP64 oracle (TP2 geometry, BF16/INT8, decode/cached/Volta prefill).
`NINFER_RAM_KV_REAL_WEIGHTS=/absolute/model.ninfer ctest -R '^ninfer_ram_kv_real_test$'`
is opt-in: default/full-window token parity, real 29.8K eviction, MTP partial commit, complete
checkpoint replay, and appended-query reuse on two V100s. It does not qualify general quality
equivalence of approximate retrieval. `tools/v100/bench_ram_kv.py` evaluates existing long-input
fixtures through HTTP/public Engine with a whole-server 32 GB cgroup cap.

The retained tests protect current `.ninfer`, numerical operator, target, runtime-transaction,
benchmark-report, and external protocol behavior. Repository verification principles are defined in
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md); Op contract and CUDA implementation guidance is in
[`../docs/maintainer/op-development.md`](../docs/maintainer/op-development.md).

## Organization

SM70 NVFP4 input checks use independent host QPN encoding and FP64 logical projection oracles
at TP1/TP2 shapes, including QPN/wide-CUTLASS boundaries and graph replay. Run
`ctest -R '^ninfer_nvfp4_(input_sm70|gdn_.*)_test$'` for projection, snapshot-state, masked
record and public TP2 split checks.

- `artifact/` — Python container, registered layout, quantization, and resource behavior;
- `ops/` — one identifiable qualification suite per semantic Op or closely related overload group,
  using independent numerical/state-transition oracles at real supported shapes;
- `ops/linear/` — weight/activation-profile-specific public Linear conformance tests plus their
  one shared input generator, FP64 GEMM oracle, tolerance registry, and output/effects mechanics;
- `ops/linear_add/`, `ops/linear_pair/`, `ops/linear_swiglu/` — fused-Op suites split by registered
  weight/activation profile, each evaluating its complete formula rather than composing production
  Ops;
- `ops/test_allreduce.cpp` — the two-device `allreduce_sum`/`allgather_rows` collectives; it needs
  two CUDA devices visible to one process and reports the shared skip code when fewer are present.
  It checks eager/captured sums, small-message route boundaries and skewed 64-round chains.
  `NINFER_TEST_PEER_OFF=1` disables peer access only inside the test process to qualify the DMA
  fallback; it does not change the system's IOMMU or driver configuration;
- `ops/test_allreduce_tp4.cpp` — four-rank FP64 summation/byte-relocation oracles, uneven
  gathers, repeated broadcasts and source reuse, and production multi-stream graph capture/replay
  gates. Both staged DMA and qualified direct-P2P paths are exercised; needs four CUDA devices;
- `ops/test_linear_tp4.cpp` — four-rank column/row projection and exactly-once residual addition
  at 27B quarter-shard geometries,
  eager and graph replay, against complete-dot FP64 oracles with represented BF16 operands.
  The oracle does not round intermediate partials; row routes use the existing two-BF16-ulp
  tensor-scale criterion. This is not qualification
  of a new FP8/NVFP4 codec or a four-rank Engine route. Needs four CUDA devices;
- `targets/qwen3_6/` — shared tokenizer/template, multimodal preprocessing, MRoPE, prepared-prompt,
  stop/output decoding, hybrid topology, decoder/GDN and round-state layouts/views, shifted-MTP
  alignment, Vision control, and family runtime mechanisms;
- `targets/qwen3_6_27b/` — registered inventory, converter recipe, source verifier, artifact
  bindings, reference diagnostics, family Program/multimodal/MTP behavior, and the opt-in real-Engine
  prefix test;
- `targets/qwen3_6_35b_a3b/` — registered inventory/converter contracts, artifact-native diagnostic
  reference, MoE oracle, typed binding, selected-expert row access, 256K INT8 memory calculation,
  and the opt-in real public-Engine route;
- `test_ninfer_artifact_reader.cpp` — C++ framing, directory, encoded-size, payload-span, and
  geometry behavior against a self-contained C++ fixture;
- `test_request_memory.cpp` — startup-frozen request-transient capacity, stable address,
  activation alignment, rejection, and peak semantics;
- `test_openai_schema.cpp`, `test_responses_schema.cpp`, `test_response_store.cpp`,
  `test_anthropic_schema.cpp`, and `test_tool_call_parser.cpp` — current protocol translation,
  Responses Item/state/SSE behavior, and incremental tool-call behavior;
- `test_request_log.cpp` and `test_http_error_handler.cpp` — generation lifecycle records,
  preparation rejections, protocol-shaped payload-limit errors, and application-error preservation;
- `test_ninfer_bench_support.cpp` — product benchmark CLI, timing boundary, and schema-v9 reports;
- `test_bench_matrix.py` — schema-v9 report consumption by the Python matrix summarizer;
- `test_serve_corpus.py` — serving request-log schema compatibility at the measurement consumer;
- device/tensor/arena tests — reusable lower-component behavior; KV tests cover the core physical
  container, family runtime tests cover dimension-driven GDN storage/view mechanics, and Op tests
  cover mathematical state transitions at their own boundary.

Tests are grouped by observable risk, not by mirroring every source file or class.
`ops/op_tester.h` and `ops/op_check.h` own only reusable device/guard and comparison mechanics.
Concrete numerical criteria remain named by the semantic Op suite; there are no cross-Op tolerance
presets.

`ops/quantized_weight.h` is the common packed-weight fixture for Q4/Q5/Q6/W8 and NVFP4 Op tests. It
owns deterministic payload generation, device `Weight` views, row views, and independent logical
weight decoding.

## Build and run

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Run a focused target for a localized change:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel --target ninfer_sampling_test
ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_sampling_test --output-on-failure
```

Enable uniform floating-point error records when establishing or reviewing an Op criterion:

```bash
NINFER_OP_REPORT_STATS=1 \
  ctest --test-dir build -V -R '^ninfer_(rmsnorm|gqa_attention)_test$'
```

Every participating comparison emits one `OP_ERROR_STATS` record containing the stable case label,
actual error, active limit, and error-to-limit ratio. The switch changes reporting only; the same
statistics still drive the normal verdict. Passing tests remain quiet without it.

Linear tests are independently runnable by weight and activation-compute profile:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel --target \
  ninfer_linear_q4_a16_test ninfer_linear_q5_a16_test \
  ninfer_linear_q6_a16_test ninfer_linear_w8_a16_test
ctest --test-dir build -R '^ninfer_linear_(q4|q5|q6|w8)_a16_test$' --output-on-failure
```

All Linear files use `ops/linear/linear_test_common.{h,cpp}` and the same
`ops/quantized_weight.h` fixture as the fused projection tests. The fixture produces the complete
packed GPU payload and exact-decodes the logical float rows used by the one
`cpu_linear_gemm_fp64()` reference. The reference performs naive double accumulation and never
reproduces a production route's activation quantization, staging, reduction tree, or BF16 output
rounding. Each activation compute path selects one centrally defined comparison tolerance for its
whole suite; private kernel, schedule, launcher, and T selection do not change it. Individual test
files call public `linear()` and contain no private selector, launcher, schedule, or kernel
assertions.

Run the native Python suites with the project Python environment:

```bash
python3 -m pytest \
  tests/artifact tests/targets/qwen3_6_27b tests/targets/qwen3_6_35b_a3b \
  tests/test_bench_matrix.py tests/test_serve_corpus.py
```

The Python binding tests use `NINFER_QWEN3_6_27B_ARTIFACT` when set, otherwise they look for
`out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer`. They report a pytest skip when neither path provides the real
artifact. The 35B-A3B reference binding test follows the same rule with
`NINFER_QWEN3_6_35B_A3B_ARTIFACT` and `out/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer`. The remaining Python
target tests still run without either artifact.

The C++ prefix/MTP integration test is separately opt-in because it loads the full artifact and
runs the real engine:

```bash
NINFER_QWEN3_6_27B_WEIGHTS=$PWD/out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_prefix_real_test --output-on-failure
```

For TP2 Vision on the official Qwen3.8 NVFP4 artifact, build
`ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_prefix_real_test` and run the retained two-device variant:

```bash
NINFER_QWEN3_6_27B_NVFP4_WEIGHTS=/absolute/path/to/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build-v100-duo -R '^ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_vision_tp2_real_test$' --output-on-failure
```

It checks real multimodal prefill, cross-chunk image lifetime, shifted MTP alignment,
same-media reuse, changed/appended media, and visual prefix bridges. To verify actual concurrent
HTTP generation, use the README's experimental Vision server profile with port `18081`,
`--max-concurrency 2`, `--vision-max-tokens 2048`, `--greedy`,
`--request-log-jsonl /tmp/ninfer-vision.jsonl` and `--log-stats-interval-ms 500` (retain
`--no-prefix-reuse`). These larger reservations require additional free GPU memory. Then run
with Python 3.11:

```bash
/path/to/python3.11 tools/v100/check_vision_http.py --request-log /tmp/ninfer-vision.jsonl
```

The HTTP check generates exact red-circle/blue-square PPM scenes on white backgrounds, verifies
their reported colors and geometry (not exact wording), tests a 1,630-token cross-chunk prompt
and two images, and sends two simultaneous streaming requests. It requires overlapping content
streams and structured-log evidence of an actual multi-row decode batch, not just two HTTP 200s.
Use a dedicated idle server with a 1,024-token prefill chunk and at least two request slots.

Run the peer 35B-A3B route independently:

```bash
NINFER_QWEN3_6_35B_A3B_WEIGHTS=$PWD/out/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_6_35b_a3b_real_test --output-on-failure
```

Without the corresponding variable CTest marks each C++ integration test as skipped. Neither test
uses another numerical/execution path's generated tokens as a golden.

The V100X2-named gates accept registered Qwen3.8 Q4_K_M/NVFP4 at TP2 (default), or
Qwen3.8 NVFP4/native block-FP8 on four SM70 cards with `NINFER_TEST_TP=4`.
`NINFER_V100X2_SPEC=mtp` (default) selects MTP3; `dflash` selects DFlash7 and requires an
artifact with the optional drafter. `NINFER_V100X2_PROPOSAL_HEAD=optimized` is MTP-only.
The real gate checks exact graph/eager commits, sampled routing and B=2 state. Q4_K_M/NVFP4
require strict non-speculative teacher-forced argmax at all 64 output positions. Native FP8
additionally measures ordinary decode's re-prefill discrepancy: each prompt's speculative
worst emitted-logit deficit must not exceed its ordinary control, within the established
0.5-logit BF16 grouping bound. This is not a bit-identical-trajectory or quality-score claim.
The prefix gate checks checkpoint, append, partial-stop and exact-frontier replay, including
an exact stop-vs-budget truncation control. Cold re-prefill can change BF16 grouping; its
first differing choice is checked separately against fresh target logits. DFlash does not
use the MTP-only peer-egress diagnostic and is unavailable at TP4.

```bash
NINFER_V100X2_ARTIFACT=/Models/ninfer-V100X2/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
NINFER_V100X2_SPEC=dflash \
  ctest --test-dir build-v100 -R 'v100x2_(real|prefix_real)' --output-on-failure
```

The capability-evaluation coordinator has its own environment and unittest entry point:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=eval eval/.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover \
  -s eval/tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

Run the serving contract manually after starting a resident server in another terminal:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18080
```

```bash
python3 -m tools.smoke.serve_contract \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080 --model qwen3.6-27b
```

This smoke check is intentionally not a CTest: it needs the real artifact, a supported GPU, and a
server process that remains alive while the client exercises OpenAI Responses/Chat, Anthropic,
state, streaming, and multimodal requests.

The thinking-preservation fixture starts and stops its own server, submits a fixed two-step tool
history, compares restored and cold greedy output, compares stripped and preserved closed-turn
prompt lengths, and verifies turn/response rewrite-checkpoint reuse paths plus Responses
inheritance:

```bash
python3 tools/smoke/serve_thinking_preservation.py \
  --artifact out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer --backend mtp

python3 tools/smoke/serve_thinking_preservation.py \
  --artifact out/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer --backend dflash
```

The shared messages are in
[`fixtures/serve/qwen3_6_thinking_preservation.json`](fixtures/serve/qwen3_6_thinking_preservation.json).

### Experimental TP2 Vision status

The TP2 Vision path is opt-in and not fully qualified on the local two V100-SXM2 16 GB cards.
With the official Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 artifact, INT8 group-64 KV, 4096 capacity, 1024 prefill chunks
and optimized-head MTP3, `ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_vision_tp2_real_test` repeatedly fails its visual-prefix
bridge greedy-output comparison at the first output token. Earlier cross-chunk image lifetime,
same/changed/appended-media reuse and stop/resume checks complete before this failure.

The differing candidates are not an exact BF16 tie, but this does not by itself establish a state
bug or a model-quality regression. The cause remains unresolved; no numerical criterion has been
relaxed and the failing test is retained. The recommended experimental Vision server uses
`--no-prefix-reuse` to avoid this cache path, not as evidence that the complete Vision route has
passed qualification.

## What belongs here

A permanent test should protect one current risk, such as:

- exact registered artifact bytes, geometry, object binding, or conversion transform;
- a numerical operator contract with an independent oracle;
- family Frontend or Program frontier, prefix, MTP, or multimodal behavior;
- generated-token commit/stop/cancel consistency;
- public benchmark or OpenAI/Anthropic observable behavior;
- a reproduced supported bug.

Performance-only assertions belong in benchmarks and profiler review. Source scans,
implementation-shape assertions, trivial getters/configuration, retired command surfaces, and
broad additions without a concrete regression risk do not belong in the permanent suite.
